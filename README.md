# FactorsAndMultliplesGameSolution

A solution for the factors and multiples game.

This program is written in Python 3 and is designed to find a solution to the following puzzle: https://nrich.maths.org/5468. (Adapted to make it a one player game).

Essentially, the file generates all the factors and multliples of a number and then picks one at random, adds the files to a list (used_numbers) and continues, checking the random number against the list. When it can't generate any more numbers it finishes the list and then makes a new one, until it gets a list of the specified length. 
If you're new to python, here's how to run it. 
1) Jump to python.org. 
2) Download python 3, for your relevant OS. 
3) You want to install python and open an app called IDLE, not run it in python terminal. 
4) Go to file > open, and open the file. 
5) Go to run > run module 
6) Sit back and relax
Otherwise you can just run it at https://repl.it/IqlJ/0.
